### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your machine.
- [DiskInternals Linux Reader](https://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/) for mounting raw disk images on Windows.

### Pull the Docker Image  

1. Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:  
    ```sh
    docker pull bugfishtm/proxmox-vma2raw:latest
    ```  
2. Run the Docker container and specify a folder to put your vma files in:  
    ```sh
    docker run -it -v C:\path\to\your\files:/opt/files bugfishtm/proxmox-vma2raw:latest
    ```  

### Usage

1. Place your `.vma` files in the `files` folder specified at the docker image deployment.

2. Access the interactive shell of the running Docker container in bash mode:
    ```sh
    docker exec -it proxmox-vma2raw /bin/bash
    ```

3. Navigate to the `/opt/files` directory:
    ```sh
    cd /opt/files
    ```

4. Extract the `.vma` file to a raw disk image:
    ```sh
    vma extract ./sourcefile.vma ./extractdir
    ```
    - Ensure `./extractdir` does not exist before running the command.

5. The raw disk image will be available in the `./extractdir` directory inside the directory you placed your .vma file in.

6. Use [DiskInternals Linux Reader](https://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/) to mount and access the raw disk image.
